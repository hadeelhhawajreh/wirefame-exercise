Have a design concept and a plan completely ready to go before you write the first line of code.

Build/Review a wireframe showing all document dimensions

Know where images will go and how big they will be
Use placeholder images during the setup process
Know where text will go and use placeholder lorem ipsum text
Set up the project repository, scaffold the files, and make sure they are wired together.
Build out all of the HTML without applying any classes or IDs
Working top to bottom in the document, put elements into place with CSS, using the structure of the HTML to create selectors wherever it is possible. Seek to limit use of classes and IDs to only where they are needed.
Apply color, backgrounds, borders, text styling, etc., to the specifications of the design
